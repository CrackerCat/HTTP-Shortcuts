Place shortcuts (widgets) on your home screen to submit HTTP requests to all your favorite RESTful APIs, webservices and other URL resources. Great for home automation projects!

<ul>
<li>HTTP and HTTPS</li>
<li>GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD, OPTIONS and TRACE</li>
<li>Basic Authentication, Digest Authentication, Bearer Authentication & Client Certificate Authentication</li>
<li>Custom request headers</li>
<li>Custom request body (text only)</li>
<li>Upload files as form-data or request body</li>
<li>Support for HTTP proxies</li>
<li>Support for self-signed certificates</li>
<li>Built-in icons, support for custom icons</li>
<li>Display response as a toast, window or dialog, or run silently</li>
<li>Grouping into categories through tabs</li>
<li>Value injection through variables (e.g., text, numbers, passwords, selections, colors, dates, …)</li>
<li>Run arbitrary JavaScript before & after execution, including special actions (e.g., vibrate, show toast, parse and process response…)</li>
<li>Import & Export in JSON or cURL format</li>
<li>3rd party integration (e.g. Tasker)</li>
<li>Dark Mode support</li>
</ul>

Some ideas what to use HTTP shortcuts for:
<ul>
<li>Execute a script on your web server</li>
<li>Control your home automation system and IoT devices</li>
<li>Interact with your RaspberryPi and Arduino tinkering projects</li>
<li>Automate workflows</li>
</ul>
